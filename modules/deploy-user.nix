# modules/deploy-user.nix
#
# The Colmena remote-deploy identity, on its own so it can be imported WITHOUT
# the rest of the opinionated fleet baseline (modules/common.nix). That matters
# for `mgmt`, which is folded in faithfully (its own base.nix owns SSH/firewall/
# ACME) and only needs this much to become Colmena-managed.
#
# A dedicated, unprivileged `deploy` user — NOT a login/admin account. The
# desktop (Colmena control node) connects as this user with its SSH key. It can
# do exactly two privileged things and nothing else:
#   1. receive unsigned closures over SSH  → it's a Nix `trusted-user`
#   2. run the NixOS activation as root    → scoped NOPASSWD sudo below
# So a stolen deploy key cannot open a general root shell — only re-activate a
# system closure. Deploy by IP; the internal domain lives on mgmt (DNS).
