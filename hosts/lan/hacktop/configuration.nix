# the fleet (Project 1 -> Project 5 runner). Adopted from the stock installer image
# (NixOS 25.11), so this converges the existing box. Baseline (SSH key-only,
# nftables w/ 22, flakes, zsh, base tools) is in ../../../modules/common.nix.

  # UniFi switch port wasn't forwarding (link up, TX only, no ARP reply from the
  # gateway), so it black-holed the default route, and being a 2nd NIC on the same
  # /24 as Wi-Fi it caused ARP flux that poisoned .26 and knocked the box offline.
  # Pulling it restored clean Wi-Fi WAN.
  # TODO (wired primary): fix/swap that switch port + cable, confirm the dongle
  # pings the gateway and the internet, add a UniFi DHCP reservation (dongle MAC ->
  # .198), then either go wired-only (Wi-Fi autoconnect off) or set

  # --- Desktop (inherited from the installer) -------------------------------

  # GNOME doesn't affect remote access. Re-enable for a local GUI.
