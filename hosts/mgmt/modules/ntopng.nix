# ntopng — live network traffic analysis at https://ntop.mgmt.lan.
# Default login admin/admin (forced change on first visit).
# It binds 0.0.0.0:3003 (the module has no bind-address option) but the
# firewall doesn't open 3003, so it's only reachable through nginx.
# Note: without switch port mirroring it sees only traffic to/from this
# host — which includes every DNS query, since AdGuard lives here.
