# fleet-hosts.nix
#
# Single source of truth for host -> LAN IP, imported by exactly two consumers:
#   - flake.nix                              : Colmena deployment.targetHost (+ the
#                                              nixosConfigurations/hive host set)
#   - hosts/lan/mgmt/modules/monitoring.nix  : Prometheus node_exporter scrape targets
#
# so the deploy host list and the metrics scrape list can never drift apart. This
# is a plain data attrset, NOT a NixOS module - import it and read attributes.
#
# Why a data file and not specialArgs (the two options the brief offered): a data
# file imported directly has one definition and cannot drift. Threading the same
# map through specialArgs would mean wiring it at four call sites that must agree -
# mkServerSystem + mkColmenaNode (servers, nixos + colmena) and mkMgmtSystem +
# mkMgmtColmenaNode (mgmt, nixos + colmena) - any one missed and the deploy view
# and the metrics view silently diverge. The data file is the lower-risk option.
#
# IPs, never names: mgmt's AdGuard serves *.mgmt.lan, so any name that has to
# resolve before DNS is up (a deploy target, a scrape target) would deadlock.
#
# `scrape` = does mgmt's Prometheus scrape this host's node_exporter on :9100?
#   mgmt   : false - it scrapes its own node_exporter over localhost (its exporter
#            binds 127.0.0.1, see hosts/lan/mgmt/modules/monitoring.nix), so a
#            remote job pointed at 192.168.1.222:9100 would never connect.
#   cloud1 : false - a public VPS with no private path to mgmt yet. Its :9100 is
#            firewalled shut and never exposed publicly (modules/common.nix
#            alcove.metrics + the opt-out in hosts/cloud/cloud1/configuration.nix).
#            Flip to true once the WireGuard/Headscale mesh (Project 4C) gives mgmt
#            a private route to it.
